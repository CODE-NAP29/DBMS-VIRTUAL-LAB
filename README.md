## üöÄ Why GitHub Copilot for DBMS?

Instead of memorizing queries, you can **learn by doing** with Copilot:
- ‚ú® **Query Suggestions**: Start typing `SELECT` or `CREATE TABLE` and Copilot suggests complete queries.  
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Error Fixing**: If your SQL syntax fails, Copilot auto-suggests corrections.  
- üéØ **Practice Generator**: Ask Copilot to create random practice queries for constraints, joins, or TCL commands.  
- üîÑ **Scenario Simulation**: Get Copilot to simulate **banking transactions**, **library systems**, or **e-commerce schemas** with `GRANT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, etc.  
- ‚ö° **Learn Faster**: Reduce time searching syntax online ‚Äî Copilot brings it inside your editor.  

> With Copilot, this repo becomes not just a static lab, but an **interactive virtual mentor**.

The scope of DBMS includes:

- **Data Modeling**: Designing databases using ER models, relational models, and schemas.  
- **Data Storage & Retrieval**: Efficient organization and querying of large datasets.  
- **Transaction Management**: Ensuring consistency, atomicity, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).  
- **Concurrency Control**: Handling simultaneous data access without conflicts.  
- **Data Integrity & Security**: Enforcing rules and restricting unauthorized access.  
- **Backup & Recovery**: Protecting against data loss.  
- **Real-World Applications**: Banking, e-commerce, reservations, inventory systems, and more.
