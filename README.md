# DBMS Virtual Lab

Welcome to the **DBMS Virtual Lab**!  
This repository provides a hands-on environment to learn and practice Database Management Systems (DBMS) concepts using Oracle SQL. You will work through practical experiments, explore common DBMS operations, and use GitHub Copilot as your coding partner to enhance and automate your learning.

---

## 🛠️ Setting Up Your DBMS Environment

To get started, you will need access to an Oracle Database. You can use:

- **Oracle Database Express Edition (XE):**  
  Download and install the free version from [Oracle XE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/xe-downloads.html).

- **Oracle Live SQL:**  
  Practice online without installation at [Oracle Live SQL](https://livesql.oracle.com/).

- **Oracle Cloud Free Tier:**  
  Set up a cloud-based Oracle database at [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).

**Recommended Tools:**
- SQL*Plus, Oracle SQL Developer, or any Oracle-compatible SQL client.
- Visual Studio Code with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) enabled for code suggestions and automation.

## 📚 What Will You Learn in This Lab?

This repository is structured to cover the following DBMS topics:

- **Database Schema Design:**  
  Learn to create tables, set data types, and define keys and constraints.

- **Data Manipulation (DML):**  
  Practice inserting, updating, and deleting data.

- **Data Querying:**  
  Write SELECT queries, apply filters, sorting, grouping, and aggregation.

- **Joins and Relationships:**  
  Explore inner, outer, and self joins; understand foreign keys and table relationships.

- **Views:**  
  Create and use views for abstraction and security.

- **Automation & Copilot Integration:**  
  Use Copilot to generate SQL, automate repetitive tasks, and debug queries.

- **Project-style Experiments:**  
  Complete hands-on experiments to build real-world database solutions (e.g., Library DB, Inventory, Student Management).

## 🌳 Branch Structure

This repository follows a simple branch structure to organize the lab work:

- **main:**  
  The default branch containing the introduction to the DBMS Virtual Lab, instructions on how to use the repository, and general guidance.

- **experiments:**  
  Dedicated branch where all DBMS experiments are maintained.  
  Inside this branch, content is organized by **topic**. Each topic folder typically contains:
  
  - **About Topic:**  
    A short explanation of the concept (e.g., DDL, DML, Joins, Views).  

  - **Examples:**  
    SQL scripts demonstrating the concept in Oracle SQL\*Plus.  

  - **Copilot Prompts to Explore:**  
    Suggested GitHub Copilot prompts to help students generate queries, explanations, and variations.  

  - **Exercises:**  
    Exercises and questions for students to attempt independently.  


> **Note:** Always read the README and instructions for each branch before starting. Switch branches using `git checkout branch-name` or via your GitHub interface.
