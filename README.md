# üìÇ DDL Commands & Schema Branch

Welcome to the **DDL Commands & Schema branch** of the Oracle DBMS Virtual Lab!

This branch is dedicated to helping you master the fundamentals of database schema design and Data Definition Language (DDL) commands using Oracle SQL. Here, you'll find everything you need to understand, practice, and experiment with DDL operations such as creating, altering, and dropping tables, as well as defining keys and constraints.

## Resources

- [DDL Commands Reference](commands.md):  
  Contains essential Data Definition Language (DDL) SQL commands with syntax and examples for easy reference.

- [DDL Practice Questions](practice.md):  
  Includes a variety of practice questions to help reinforce and test your understanding of DDL operations in SQL.

- [DDL Copilot Prompts](prompts.md):  
  Features curated prompts designed for use with **GitHub Copilot** to explore and deepen your knowledge of DDL concepts interactively.

## How to Use

1. **commands.md**  
   Review the most common DDL commands, their syntax, and see ready-to-use SQL code examples.

2. **practice.md**  
   Attempt the practice questions to strengthen your understanding and application of DDL concepts.

3. **prompts.md**  
   Use these prompts with **GitHub Copilot** to generate, explain, and experiment with DDL code in real-time.

## üß™ How to Use This Branch

1. **Start with `schema/schema.sql`**  
   Review and execute the script to create all necessary tables and constraints in your Oracle database.

2. **Insert Sample Data**  
   Use `schema/insert_sample.sql` to populate your tables for further practice and querying.

3. **Explore with Prompts**  
   Open `prompts/ddl.md` and use the suggested prompts in Copilot to generate or explain DDL statements.

4. **Practice with Examples**  
   Study and run the examples in `examples/ddl_examples.sql` to see DDL operations in action.

5. **Complete the Experiment**  
   Work through the tasks in `exercises/experiment1.md` to reinforce your understanding and skills.
