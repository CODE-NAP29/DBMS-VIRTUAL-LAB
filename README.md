# üìÇ DDL Commands & Schema Branch

Welcome to the **DDL Commands & Schema branch** of the Oracle DBMS Virtual Lab!

This branch is dedicated to helping you master the fundamentals of database schema design and Data Definition Language (DDL) commands using Oracle SQL. Here, you'll find everything you need to understand, practice, and experiment with DDL operations such as creating, altering, and dropping tables, as well as defining keys and constraints.

---

## üìã What You'll Find in This Branch

- **`schema/`**  
  Contains ready-to-use SQL scripts for creating database schemas (`schema.sql`) and inserting sample data (`insert_sample.sql`).  
  Use these scripts to set up your working database environment in Oracle SQL Plus or any Oracle-compatible client.

- **`prompts/ddl.md`**  
  A curated set of Copilot prompts to help you explore, generate, and understand DDL commands.  
  Use these prompts in VS Code with GitHub Copilot for interactive learning or automation.

- **`examples/ddl_examples.sql`**  
  Example SQL scripts demonstrating various DDL operations, best practices, and advanced schema features.

- **`exercises/experiment1.md`**  
  A hands-on experiment guide focused on DDL tasks and schema creation.  
  Follow the experiment steps, try the challenges, and practice running your scripts in SQL Plus.

## üß™ How to Use This Branch

1. **Start with `schema/schema.sql`**  
   Review and execute the script to create all necessary tables and constraints in your Oracle database.

2. **Insert Sample Data**  
   Use `schema/insert_sample.sql` to populate your tables for further practice and querying.

3. **Explore with Prompts**  
   Open `prompts/ddl.md` and use the suggested prompts in Copilot to generate or explain DDL statements.

4. **Practice with Examples**  
   Study and run the examples in `examples/ddl_examples.sql` to see DDL operations in action.

5. **Complete the Experiment**  
   Work through the tasks in `exercises/experiment1.md` to reinforce your understanding and skills.
