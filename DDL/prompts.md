# Prompts to Explore DDL with **GitHub Copilot**

Use these prompts to explore DDL concepts in depth using **GitHub Copilot**.

- Ask **Copilot** to generate a SQL script that creates three related tables: "students", "courses", and "enrollments" with appropriate primary and foreign keys.
- Prompt **Copilot** to show how to use the ALTER TABLE command to add, modify, and drop columns.
- Write a prompt asking **Copilot** to explain the difference between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE commands in SQL.
- Ask **Copilot** to demonstrate creating a table with various constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL).
- Request **Copilot** to generate SQL statements for altering a table to add a new constraint.
- Challenge **Copilot** to provide a script that renames a column in a table and discuss compatibility across different SQL dialects (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc).
- Ask **Copilot** to create a SQL statement that creates a table with an auto-incrementing primary key.
- Request **Copilot** to show how to drop only a specific constraint from a table.
- Write a prompt for **Copilot** to review and optimize a DDL script for creating a normalized database schema.
- Ask **Copilot** to generate a migration script that performs multiple DDL changes in sequence (create, alter, drop).
